### Getting started with CS50 IDE
Go to [ide.cs50.io](https://ide.cs50.io/) and click "Log in" to access/setup your CS50 IDE!

📝 [CS50 IDE](https://ide.cs50.io/) is a web-based "integrated development environment" that allows you to program "in the cloud," without installing any software locally. Indeed, [CS50 IDE](https://ide.cs50.io/) provides you with your very own "workspace" (i.e., storage space) in which you can save your own files and folders (a.k.a. directories).

✍️ Useful CS50 IDE keybindings/shortcuts
- `Alt + S` (switch between "text editor" and "terminal window")
- `Ctrl + S` (save file)
- `Alt + N` (new file)
- `Ctrl + /` (comment/uncomment)
